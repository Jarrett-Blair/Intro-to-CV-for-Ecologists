# Intro-to-CV-for-Ecologists
This repository is meant to be used with the worked example from "A gentle introduction to computer vision-based specimen classification in ecological datasets" from the Journal of Animal Ecology.

To make it easier to follow, the headers within the Jupyter Notebook files follow the headers of the worked example section. The only exceptions are additional subheaders in the notebook files to specify the purpose of each section.

For the traditional machine learning tutorial, all the required code can be found in the `R-Code.ipynb` file. For the deep learning tutorial, data preparation and evaluation code can be found in the `R-Code.ipynb` file, whereas code for training the deep learning model can be found in the `Python-Code.ipynb` file.
