# Intro-to-CV-for-Ecologists
This repository is meant to be used with the worked example from "A gentle introduction to computer vision-based specimen classification in ecological datasets" from the Journal of Animal Ecology.

For data preparation, model training, and evaluation of the tabular models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forests), see 'R-Code.ipynb'. For data preparation, model training, and evaluation of the direct-from-image models (ResNet-50, VGG-16, and custom CNN), see 'Python-Code.ipynb'.
